            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages
            — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
            content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
            decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
            path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
            syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
            HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how
            it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in
            a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
            paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links
            are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the
            text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very
            basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will
            be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by
            the author of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like
            that. Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in
            the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

            Before starting this module, you should have:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web
              passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)
            </li>
            <li>
              A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic
              software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files,
              as detailed in Dealing with files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to
              HTML module.

          <p>
            As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
            documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language
            — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come
            across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example
            changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to
            create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a
            layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related
            information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
        <header>CSS Syntax</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of
            styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
            elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
            my page to be shown as large red text."
          </p>
          <p>
            The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve
            the styling described above:
          </p>
          <code>
            h1 {<br />
            color: red;<br />
            font-size: 5em;<br />
            }</code
          >
          <p>
            The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that
            we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one
            headings (h1).
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or
            more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs.
            Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting,
            then a value that we'd like to give the property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the
            value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on
            which property is being specified. In our example, we have the
            <em>color</em> property, which can take various color values. We
            also have the <em>font-size</em> property. This property can take
            various size units as a value.
          </p>
          <p>
            A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the
            other.
          </p>
          <code>
            h1 {<br />
            color: red;<br />
            font-size: 5em;<br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            p {<br />
            color: black;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you
            will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you
            a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget,
            or want to know what else you can use as a value.

        <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
            we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
            ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
            across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
            way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it
            as <em>styles.css</em>. The <em>.css</em> extension shows that this
            is a CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            To link <em>styles.css</em> to <em>index.html</em> add the following
            line somewhere inside the

            <em>head</em> of the HTML document:
          </p>
          <code>
            <span><</span>link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" <span>></span>
          </code>
          <p>
            This <em>link</em> element tells the browser that we have a
            stylesheet, using the <em>rel</em> attribute, and the location of
            that stylesheet as the value of the <em>href</em> attribute. You can
            test that the CSS works by adding a rule to <em>styles.css</em>.
            Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:
          </p>
          <code>
            h1 {<br />
            color: red;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser.
            The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red.
            If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied
            some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully
            check that you've typed everything correctly.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_Elements">
        <header>Styling HTML Elements</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can
            target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
            <em>element selector</em> — this is a selector that directly matches
            an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you
            would use the selector <em>p</em>. To turn all paragraphs green you
            would use:
          </p>
          <code>
            p {<br />
            color: green;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the
            selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items
            to be green my rule looks like this:
          </p>
          <code>
            p, li {<br />
            color: green;<br />
            }
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>

      >
        <header>Changing the default behaviour of HTML Elements</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as
            simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML
            readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold
            and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have
            internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to
            all pages by default; without them all of the text would run
            together in a clump and we would have to style everything from
            scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in
            pretty much the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, you will often want something other than the choice the
            browser has made. This can be done by simply choosing the HTML
            element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the
            way it looks. A good example is our <em>ul</em>, an unordered list.
            It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I
            can remove them like so:
          </p>
          <code>
            li {<br />
            list-style-type: none;<br />
            }
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section
        class="main-section"
        id="Styling_things_based_on_their_location_in_a_document"
      >
        <header>Styling things based on their location in a document</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            There are times when you will want something to look different based
            on where it is in the document. To select only an <em>em</em> that
            is nested inside an <em>li</em> element I can use a selector called
            the descendant combinator, which simply takes the form of a space
            between two other selectors.
          </p>
          <p>Add the following rule to your stylesheet.</p>
          <code>
            li em {<br />
            color: rebeccapurple;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it
            comes directly after a heading at the same hierarchy level in the
            HTML. To do so place a + (an adjacent sibling combinator) between
            the selectors.
          </p>
          <p>Try adding this rule to your stylesheet as well:</p>
          <code>
            h1 + p {<br />
            font-size: 200%;<br />
            }
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Styling_things_based_on_State">
        <header>Styling things based on State</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial
            is the ability to style things based on their state. A
            straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style
            a link we need to target the <em>a</em> (anchor) element. This has
            different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited,
            being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of
            being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target these different
            states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited links
            green.
          </p>
          <code>
            a:link {<br />
            color: pink;<br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            a:visited {<br />
            color: green;<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it,
            for example removing the underline, which is achieved by in the next
            rule:
          </p>
          <code>
            a:hover {<br />
            text-decoration: none;<br />
            }
          </code>

        <header>Combining selectors and combinators</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and
            combinators together. For example:
          </p>
          <code>
            /* selects any span that is inside a p, which is inside an article
            */ <br />
            article p span { ... } <br />
            <br />
            /* selects any p that comes directly after a ul, which comes
            directly after an h1 */ <br />
            h1 + ul + p { ... }
          </code>

        <header>Applying CSS to HTML</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document:
            with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with
            inline styles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              External stylesheet
              <p>
                An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a
                .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of
                bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to
                multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS
                stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an
                external stylesheet to our web page.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal stylesheet
              <p>
                An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To
